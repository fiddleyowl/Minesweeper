Used Libraries:

com.github.Dansoftowner:jSystemThemeDetector:2.1
For automatic detection of dark mode. Another implementation is app.PublicDefinitions:isMacOSDark. Due to the fact that my implementation can only detect dark mode on macOS, the library is used for cross-platform detecting.

de.jangassen:nsmenufx:3.1.0
For integration with macOS native menu bar. The internal method is not as good as this external one.

io.github.typhon0:AnimateFX:1.2.2
For simple animation.

net.kurobako:gesturefx:0.6.0
For the zoomable minefield. Cache was set manually to increase performance. Native pane becomes slow if zoomed to a large scale.

org.openjfx:javafx-maven-plugin:0.0.5
For packaging macOS .app application for distribution.
